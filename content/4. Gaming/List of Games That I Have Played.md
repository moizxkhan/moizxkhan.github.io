Categorising games is way harder than categorising books. With books, you can usually stick them into predefined genres, but games? Forget it. So much overlap happens that trying to slap a label like “action-adventure” on a game with a dozen other elements is basically futile. It could be open-world, linear, story-driven, who even knows?

To keep my list readable (and spare you from getting an aneurysm), I’ve organised games in their own categories. Sometimes by developer, sometimes by distinctive characteristics. Most games fall under action-adventure, story-driven. I won’t be fussing over open-world vs. linear or first-person vs. third-person except for FPS shooters, where being a shooter is the whole point.

The kernel is a core part of the [[Operating System]]. It acts as a bridge between the hardware of the computer and the software/applications running on it.

Few types of kernels are
1. Monolithic
2. Microkernel
3. Hybrid Kernel

I like to imagine the [[Operating System]]. As a collection of concentric circles. The innermost part being the kernel whose access is not given to the base user or even the administrator on some Operating Systems and the outer layers being the shell and other important components of the OS.

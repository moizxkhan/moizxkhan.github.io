Artificial Intelligence is the designing of systems, software and applications to perform tasks that mimic human intelligence. There are many sub categories of artificial intelligence. We can divide AI on the basis of their sub technologies, sub fields, functionalities, capabilities and so on. Let us divide them on the basis of their types. There are two types of AI
1. one is weak AI or also called as narrow AI and the other is 
2. strong AI also called as AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). 

The more specific types of AI are 
1. Limited Memory AI
2. Reactive AI
3. Theory-of-Mind AI
4. Self Aware AI

Out of these only Limited and Reactive Memory AI have been realised i.e have been made a reality but Theory-of-Mind AI and Self Aware AI are still a thing of the future and have not become a reality yet. That technology is yet to be developed. We can divide Artificial Intelligence on the basis of capabilities as well. They are
1. Machine Learning
2. Deep Learning
3. Neural Networks
4. Computer Vision
5. Natural Language Processing
6. I FORGOT THIS ONE

Computer Science is an ever evolving field with a rich history. The modern day world is being around the genesis and evolution of technology. So it makes sense to have a deep understanding of the field that constantly changes and shapes our new reality.

Over in this section of the vault I will be maintaining notes about everything related to computers. From its history to in depth technical details while also leaving my 2 cents on certain topics alongside insights that I collect over my course of learning.

I will make a one intensive constant work-in-progress note about Computer Science linking other concepts that I have learned to form an intuitive knowledge bank that condenses the dense information and makes it easier for the brain to recall in times of need.

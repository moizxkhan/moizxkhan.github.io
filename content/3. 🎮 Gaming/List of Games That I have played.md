Categorising games is harder than categorising books. I found it easier to put books in their pre defined genre but with games? I just cannot cause there is so much overlap among games that it becomes a futile and pointless affair to put a tag on a game saying it is action adventure when it has so many other things going on for it. It may be an open world or a linear story driven game who knows. So to organise my list and make it easy for the reader to see my list without getting an aneurysm I have put games in their own categories sometimes I will categorise games under a certain developer other times by their distinctive characteristics. Most games would lie under action adventure story driven. I will not be categorising whether it is an open world or a linear game, a first person game or a third person game (except for fps shooters whose whole purpose is to be a shooter game) and so on.

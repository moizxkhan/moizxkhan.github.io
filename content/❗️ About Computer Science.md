Computer Science is an ever evolving field with a rich history.

Some trends about computer science that I have noticed is with the naming of things. There a lot of ways something is named and the naming is not rigid. You have many words which essentially mean the same thing or sometimes you may feel that they do the same thing but in fact they may not and the reason why it may feel that way maybe due to lack of knowledge. Be mindful of this when learning about computer science.

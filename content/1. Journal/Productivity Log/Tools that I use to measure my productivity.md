For time tracking and time management I use an android app called as  [YPT](https://www.yeolpumta.com/en/)(Yeolpumpta) which roughly translates to passion timer in English. It helps me stay focused on the task and allows my mind to enter a state where I can fully focus without letting other things get in the way. I will post screenshots of the tasks that I did and the report available in the YPT app over here as a means of record.

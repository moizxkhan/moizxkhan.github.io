Hello, I'm Moiz Khan.

This is my digital vault, a place where I write about what I’m learning, explore ideas that interest me, and keep track of my progress over time.

I’m a curious person who enjoys learning something new every day. Here, I’ll be sharing notes on whatever captures my attention, from reflections on daily learning to thoughts on my hobbies and interests, as well as documenting the growth I’ve made, am making, and will continue to make in my education and career.

This vault is like a living and breathing entity which I will be constantly updating and maintaining. It is by no means perfect and may contain some errors, grammatical or otherwise. I will do my best to uphold a good quality standard of my vault. 

If you come across something that does not make sense to you then it is okay it may not be intended for you but for me or some notes may be unfinished as I will be dumping information so I do not forget to come back later and organise it properly. 

Thank you for taking the time to go through my vault, I hope you find it useful or intriguing in some way or the other.

## Overview of The Vault

### [[1. Journal]]

In this section of the vault I will be noting down my actions that I took to learn something, my thoughts and feelings regarding the process and everything related to it. Besides that I also will note down thoughts, feelings, opinions along with facts that I come across in my day to day life that I find interesting. 

### [[2. Computer Science]]

This will be a major section of the vault because my learning for the most part revolves around computers and everything related to it. As the vault expands I will probably add a section called knowledge vault and then include computer science in it but as of now this shall suffice. 

### [[3. Reading]]

Reading is a big hobby of mine and I consider it a valuable skill as well. The ability to read and maintain focus for long hours comes especially handy when reading documentation of software, trying to troubleshoot your code and what not. Besides being useful in my education and career, I just plain and simple enjoy reading just for the fun of it. In this section I am maintaining a list of books I have read, will read and currently reading also with annotations and excerpts from them. 

### [[4. Gaming]]

Games are an amazing form of medium to express stories which other medium like movies or songs cannot (well maybe web series can) solely because the time games get to build characters, stories and the plot and a major factor lacking in other medium that is the interaction required from the player. This part will contain a list of games that I have played and reviews of a select few games that I like. 

### [[5. Fitness]]

Fitness section will contain information and knowledge regarding health and fitness. Everything that I will learn from my personal experiences and also other credible sources will be noted down in this section. Your health matters the most people! Take good care of it and it will take care of you in your old age.

title: Welcome to my Vault!

Hello, I'm Moiz Khan.

This is my digital vault, a place where I write about what I’m learning, explore ideas that interest me, and keep track of my progress over time.

I’m a curious person who enjoys learning something new every day. Here, I’ll be sharing notes on whatever captures my attention, from reflections on daily learning to thoughts on my hobbies and interests, as well as documenting the growth I’ve made, am making, and will continue to make in my education and career.

This vault is like a living and breathing entity which I will be constantly updating and maintaining.

Thank you for taking the time to go through my vault, I hope you find it useful or intriguing in some way or the other.
